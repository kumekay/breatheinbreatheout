# "Breathe In, Breathe Out" Userscript Features

This script is designed to help you be more mindful about accessing websites that you find distracting.

## Core Functionality

*   **Mindful Access Timer**: When you try to visit a website on your configured list, a 15-second countdown timer will appear.
*   **Focus is Key**: To proceed to the website, you must keep the tab with the timer in focus. If you switch to another tab or window, the timer will reset. This encourages you to be present and intentional.
*   **Accessing the Site**: Once the 15-second timer completes successfully, you will be able to access the website.

## Cooldown Period

After the timer completes, you have the option to set a "cooldown" period.

*   **Cooldown Options**: You can choose from the following durations:
    *   5 minutes
    *   20 minutes
    *   2 hours
*   **Effect of Cooldown**: After the timer completes, you must select a cooldown period. During this period, you can access the configured websites without the timer appearing.

## Website Configuration

*   **Customizable List**: The list of websites that trigger the timer is defined within the script. Advanced users can edit the script directly to add or remove websites from this list.
